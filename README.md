Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
Rules for using hooks:
Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional
